# Advent of Code

Every year in december, an online calender is started on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Every day at midnight EST/UTC-5 a new puzzle is released.

The puzzles contain a little story about saving christmas by collecting 50 stars throughout the entire month of december, 2 per day.

A puzzle consists of an input unique to each participant. The rules on what to do with this input are hidden within the text. In the end, a single number is submitted to test for correctness. This allows the calneder to stay language-independant, as only the solution and not the way of finding the solution is tested.

## Years

The calender started in 2015 and has continued every year since then. This repository contains solutions for the tasks I have already completed and usually I even adhere to the same format!

### What is already implemented

Any folder where the last commit was the third one has not yet been implemented, everything with a newer commit should have at least been partially implemented
